SQL queries -> :[project_sql](/project_sql/)

# Background
Motivated by a need to better understand the data analyst job market, this project aims to identify high-paying jobs and in-demand skills, making it easier for others to find the best opportunities.

Data collected from [Luke Barousse](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1moeWYoUtUklJO6NJdWo9OV8zWjRn0rjN). It is filled with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For an in-depth exploration of the data analyst job market, I utilized several essential tools:

- **SQL:** The core of my analysis, enabling me to query the database and extract crucial insights.

- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system I selected, perfect for managing job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred tool for managing the database and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub:** Crucial for version control and sharing SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query in this project was designed to investigate specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s my approach for each question:

### 1. Top paying Data Analyst Jobs

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```

To identify the skills required for top-paying jobs, I combined job postings with skills data, offering insights into what employers prioritize for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

Here's the breakdown of the most in-demand skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
